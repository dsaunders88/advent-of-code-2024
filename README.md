# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions using Typescript and Deno.

## Requirements

- [Deno](https://deno.com/)

## Usage

Each day's puzzle is found the corresponding `src` directory. Each day has its own directory with an `input.txt` (not tracked in this repo) and an `index.ts` file.

Solve for each day by running the following:

```sh
deno task solve [ARGUMENTS]
```

| Argument | Example Value | Description                                                     |
| :------- | :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--day`  | 01            | The two-digit day to solve for, e.g. `deno task solve --day=01` |

Running this `deno task` will log the solutions to both parts of the puzzle.
